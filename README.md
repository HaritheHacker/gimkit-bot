# gimkit-bot
Cause total havoc on gimkit games by earning FAR too much money - because it's a bot - not you - answering the questions.

Takes about 2 minutes to max out all upgrades, minus time wasted guessing at answers.

**UPDATE: GimKit 4.0 has introduced changes specifically targeted to break this bot. The changes rely on using the "isTrusted" property, which can be faked by browser extensions, as well as by browsers, such as electron. Help is wanted in working around these changes.**
